# Portfolio-Projects
This repository will hold all of my Python coding Projects.

Currently, I have a Yahoo Finance Web Scraper Project (Part 1) and an Exploratory Data Analysis on Home Loan Data on Python.

I also have a continuation of the Python Web Scraper Project in PowerBi, called Yahoo Finance Web Scraper Project (Part 2). It should be available for public access/download as long as you have PowerBi downloaded on your device. Likewise, the primary page is featured directly below. If there are any issues accessing the report, please reach out to me and I will gladly share either the file or a PDF with you through email.
