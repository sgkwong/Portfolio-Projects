# Portfolio-Projects
This repository will hold all of my Python coding Projects.

Currently, I have a Yahoo Finance Web Scraper Project (Part 1) and an Exploratory Data Analysis on Home Loan Data on Python.

I also have a continuation of the Python Web Scraper Project in PowerBi, called Yahoo Finance Web Scraping Project (Part 2). It should be available for public access as long as you have PowerBi downloaded on your device.
